# JSConf-LastCall

This repo contains the slides for the ChakraCore announcement at [JSConf Last Call](http://lastcall.jsconf.us/), which took place in Jacksonville, Florida on 5-6 December, 2015.  

ChakraCore is the core of Chakra, Microsoft Edge's JavaScript engine, which is slated to be open sourced in January 2016. The sources for the same will be available at GitHub under MIT license. Read more about the announcement at: https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/12/05/open-source-chakra-core/

For the two demos we showed during the announcement - Candy Robot and Time Travel Debugging, weâ€™ll share sources/more details when the sources for ChakraCore go live.
